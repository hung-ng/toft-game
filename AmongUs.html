                    It may have originally come out in 2018, but Among Us took 2020 by storm, and it's deserving of that
                    spotlight. Innersloth has made the tense, multiplayer fun of in-person cloak and dagger games like
                    Mafia and Werewolf work on PC, mobile, and consoles with a flourish. And the great times I've had
                    slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took
                    so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out,
                    just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and
                    again in my down time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The premise of Among Us is simple enough that just about anyone can pick it up quickly: eight crew
                    members dash around a claustrophobic, cartoon spaceship to complete simple minigames and fill up a
                    shared progress bar. But among them are two hidden impostors with the goal of secretly murdering
                    everyone until they equal or outnumber the crew and claim victory. And yet, like so many excellent
                    multiplayer games, it's very tricky to master because it’s about fooling real people, not gaming an
                    AI. You can't even fall back on the same successful strategies too often or your opponents will
                    catch on, so sometimes you have to mix things up and maybe even act illogically to keep them
                    guessing.

                    <br>
                    The art is whimsical, with your bulbous, quirky astronauts stumbling around engine bays and reactor
                    decks that look like the doodles I used to do in the margins of my notes in school. This is
                    effective for a couple of reasons. For one, it keeps the mood pretty light, which is important in a
                    game where you're going to be lying to, and being lied to, by your friends every single round. It's
                    hard to take getting ganked in the middle of a task for the fifth time too personally when the
                    animation for your demise makes you laugh after you're done yelling. The art style also makes
                    interacting with the various machines and doodads on the map intuitive and enjoyable. I was able to
                    drop right into my first match and get a decent grasp of what was going on without needing much
                    help.

                    The tasks the crew will be rushing to complete present a good variety of tiny minigames, from
                    finishing a simple maze to connecting colored wires. Most of them will test memory or hand-eye
                    coordination in a way that requires you to keep your cool, which can be a challenge when you know
                    there are murderers running around, out for your blood. The fact that most of the minigames cover up
                    a significant portion of your screen is a really effective way to build tension, too. Even tasks
                    like Download, which just makes you sit and watch a progress bar fill up, have me going, "Come on…
                    come onnn!" Any movement at the edges of my monitor could mean impending death, and you know skilled
                    impostors will use these blind spots to their advantage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Playing as the impostor is definitely the most fun for me, and it requires a variety of skills to do
                    well. Isolating your target so no one witnesses the crime is the easiest way to get away with it,
                    but if you do get caught by only one other person, being able to pin the kill on them by lying over
                    in-game text chat or an external voice app like Discord can save you from being cast out. Impostors
                    can also use the well-placed vents on each map to flee the scene, but you have to be careful not to
                    be spotted in two disconnected rooms in a way that makes it clear you took a shortcut. But I enjoy
                    being on the other side as well: As a crewmate, it's a thrilling detective game to try and keep
                    track of where everyone is, who they were with, and poke holes in their alibis at each meeting in a
                    way that will convince the other players to vote them off the ship.

                    <br>
                    It's delightfully satisfying to lead either the impostor or the crew team to victory, because much
                    like in poker, you're playing the other players more than anything. If you group up with the same
                    people often enough, you can pick up on their tells. Some of my friends will stay dead silent if
                    they're impostors, while others will start yelling and trying to direct the blame on anyone else the
                    second the first body is found. There's a lot of mental juggling that goes into sussing out a
                    killer, because you have to remember when and where you saw everyone and, ideally, ask the right
                    questions to catch them in a lie without making it too obvious that's what you're doing. Then, you
                    need to make a compelling case. Because even if you know who the impostor is 100 percent, that won't
                    matter if you can't convince the other voters.

                    <br>
                    Some of my favorite impostor rounds have been those in which I coasted to victory in a public game
                    by changing my handle to something unassuming, like "joey07", and acting like I'm a young kid who
                    doesn't really understand the rules that well. Aside from how I type and what I do or do not choose
                    to comment on, I can even make a big show of having a hard time getting around the ship or not
                    understanding how crew tasks work. Knowing how to perform innocence, even to the point that you half
                    believe you're innocent yourself, is a great skill to have. But it's a common enough strategy that
                    if you overdo it, at this point, experienced players will catch on. So sometimes I have two cover
                    identities: one that's way too obvious, and another that I want my opponents to figure out and think
                    that's the final layer. But it's not. The mind games can get really deep, and they're my favorite
                    part of Among Us.

                    <br>
                    It works so well in part because the default map, a spaceship called The Skeld, is very well
                    balanced. There’s a clever, circular layout, a mix of bottlenecks and open spaces, and just enough
                    room for impostors to maneuver unseen if you’re not watching for them at the right moment. The other
                    two maps, Mira HQ and Polus, are a bit too fragmented and spread out, which can give the impostors a
                    big advantage. That hasn’t been too big a problem for me, though, because the wide variety of game
                    options allow you to tweak things in the crew or impostors' favor with toggles like anonymous voting
                    and confirming someone's role when they're ejected. This also offers flexible difficulty when
                    playing with a group of more or less experienced killers.

                    There are some technical issues, still. Finding a match can be frustrating, since the clunky, dated
                    browser only shows you a limited number of lobbies at a time. It can be tricky to find games that
                    aren’t already full or are a long way from getting there. And the fact that there's no mechanic to
                    punish players who rage-quit when they don't get to play as impostor, or are caught dead to rights
                    in the middle of a murder; those can lead entire rounds to premature, unsatisfying endings. Adding a
                    quick match button and some way to disincentivize quitters, like a time out before you can join
                    another match if you quit too often, would both go a long way – not to mention built-in voice chat
                    support.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Among Us lives up to the hype created by its delayed explosion in popularity, for the most part.
                    It's a style of intense, refreshing multiplayer experience that simply didn't catch on digitally
                    before recently. Its well-earned following speaks to just how enticing murdering and deceiving your
                    friends can be, as well as Innersloth's endearing art, approachability, and clever minigame design.
                    I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re
                    already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite. But it’s the breakout hit for the
                    genre, and it's a great first impression.
