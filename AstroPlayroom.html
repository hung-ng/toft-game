                    For a free game that comes with the PlayStation 5, one largely designed just to showcase all the
                    bells and whistles of Sony’s next-gen DualSense controller, Astro’s Playroom is surprisingly fun.
                    It’s not just a great toybox to experience the DualSense’s haptic feedback, adaptive triggers,
                    microphone, and more, it also delivers the best proof-of-concept pack-in I’ve played since Wii
                    Sports. This is a truly joyous homage to PlayStation history, as well as an experimental platformer
                    I can only hope to see turned into a larger experience during the PS5’s lifetime.
                    Developed by Team Asobi, Astro’s Playroom follows in the impressive footsteps of its excellent PSVR
                    exclusive, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission. Much like that adventure crafted its levels and challenges
                    around the concept of viewing a platformer in VR, here Team Asobi has really considered what it
                    means to build one around the DualSense. You could technically play these levels without any of the
                    DualSense’s new functionality, but like its predecessor Playroom serves as a strong argument for
                    just how immersive an experience can be when fully using this new technology.
             <br>
             <br>
                    Astro’s literal Playroom is, amusingly, the “inside” of your PlayStation 5 console, with its CPU
                    Plaza hub offering you gateways to four main worlds: Cooling Springs, GPU Jungle, Memory Meadows,
                    and SSD Speedway. Each offers a unique approach to conveying sensation through the DualSense and
                    features its own platforming hooks, ranging from the just alright act of rolling a ball around using
                    the touchpad in Memory Meadows to the enjoyable jumping frog suit of Cooling Springs to the stellar
                    monkey climbing and swinging of GPU Jungle.

                    <br>
                    Across all of them, you’ll still mostly be getting around with the basic running, jumping, punching,
                    spin attacking, and hovering present in Rescue Mission. It’s a simple control scheme that anyone
                    should be able to grasp easily, with Astro still having quite the sensitive jump and hovering window
                    that really requires some precision. By keeping Astro’s basic movement options simple, Team Asobi is
                    able to keep layering new ideas and new mechanics on top of those controls, which creates a
                    continuous stream of inventive uses for them in Playroom’s various worlds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of that is, fundamentally, tied around the fun of using the DualSense controller. As the first
                    real showcase of how its haptic feedback allow players to “feel” things like the trudge of a
                    character walking through mud, or the difference between being in water versus on a grassy plain,
                    Astro Bot does an impressive job of showcasing the variety of what it can pull off. Water emits a
                    light, wavy pulse through the controller to mimic Astro’s swimming, while ice offers light,
                    consistent taps of rumble that are coupled with a simulated ice sound coming from the controller’s
                    speaker.
                    <br>
             <br>
                    One way Astro Bot cleverly sows the seeds of these concepts – which do a remarkable job of
                    consistently tricking my brain into buying into the different topography – is the lobby hallway
                    ahead of each world. Before jumping into any of the locales (all of which are just a simple
                    animation away, with no loading screens in between), the portal to each world features the type of
                    terrain you’ll primarily encounter. So, before hopping into Cooling Springs, there’s a small pool
                    for Astro to splash around in, or ahead of SSD Speedway, I can stomp around the mechanical mesh
                    platforms that will blanket the upcoming levels. They’re the most subtle uses of the DualSense, but
                    it’s a nice way to set the scene.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But once you do dive in, there’s no shortage of joy that comes from how Team Asobi has translated
                    in-game surfaces, objects, and movement into different DualSense sensations. Hail hitting my bot on
                    the head causes little pops of rumble to strike all around the controller, the pull of a bow and
                    arrow requires some added pressure on the trigger coupled with the satisfying plunk of release as
                    the arrow shoots out. But perhaps the aspects that best show how developers can successfully elicit
                    the feeling of swimming through water or pushing against a gust of wind is when Team Asobi combines
                    multiple DualSense features to produce a result greater than the sum of its parts.

                    <br>
                    The combinations can be something simple like running a finger up the touchpad slowly to zip Astro
                    into a new suit, while the realistic sound of a zipper cinching up plays and the DualSense thumps
                    depending on how slowly or quickly you zip. Or it can become more complex, like the Memory
                    Meadows-specific mechanic of a little spaceship suit Astro can wear, which uses both adaptive
                    triggers to control the velocity of your ship’s thrusters, for which there’s also haptic feedback to
                    indicate how much the ship is rumbling (or if you bump into any walls) while the rocket exhaust
                    sound lowers and raises depending on how fast you’re going. Yes, the haptic feedback plays a big
                    part in all this, like when raindrops start falling harder on Astro’s head and the pitter patter
                    tremble of your controller simultaneously grows – but it’s the added hook of rain sounds emanating
                    from the its speaker that really made me think “Oh no, I need to get out of this rain.”
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A lot of the ways Team Asobi integrates these features are experiential – feeling the flow of grass
                    as Astro runs through a field, the gust of wind that tries to blow you off a platform, or the odd,
                    rippling rumble as you swim through water. But the world-specific gameplay mechanics are where some
                    of the studio’s genius most lies, in mixing fun platforming curveballs with some of the DualSense’s
                    coolest sensations. Each Playroom world is structurally the same: two sets of two alternating
                    levels, the first and third featuring more traditional 3D platforming and exploration, while the
                    second and fourth offer a world-specific suit for Astro to wear. And it’s most of these portions
                    where Team Asobi’s knack for inventive levels really shines.

                    <br>
                    My favorite of them is GPU Jungle’s full robotic monkey suit, which leads to vertically-scrolling,
                    2D-view levels. As the monkey, Astro scales upward by grabbing onto rock climbing handholds, which
                    require you to alternatingly grab on with a trigger (representing one hand), physically turn the
                    DualSense left or right to raise the other arm, and then grab a subsequent handhold. Broken up by
                    cables the monkey can spin around and launch off of, some handholds necessitate you only squeeze the
                    trigger slightly or risk causing them to crumble and drop you to your doom, making this mechanic a
                    real test of delicacy.

                    Other suits have Astro hopping into the aforementioned ship, which actually controls quite like the
                    ships of digital PS3 classic PixelJunk Shooter – it can be quite easy to overshoot and hit an
                    electrified wall, so there’s a nice balance of joyously zooming around and precise movement needed
                    to survive. The frog suit of Cooling Springs is an absolute treasure in its DualSense use, though
                    the levels are not necessarily my favorites. The reproduction of a spring coil via haptics, the
                    triggers, and the speaker is outstanding, but I also found it unwieldy to actually aim and pretty
                    easy to overshoot or just miss a precariously small landing spot.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lastly, the final suit turns Astro into a ball that requires you to constantly flick a finger across
                    the touchpad to propel yourself forward, pressing it to stop the ball’s momentum entirely. These
                    levels are… fine. They’re challenging enough to test your reflexes as you try not to fall into a
                    cloudy abyss, and the screeching halt of a stop allows for some pretty precarious sections, but it’s
                    not too different from any sort of rolling ball puzzle I’ve played in plenty of other games.

                    <br>
                    These varied suits nicely keep the pace from ever slowing down, with the first level featuring any
                    of these mechanics often being a good place to learn the ropes and the second offering some sincere
                    challenge. The more traditional levels between them are less about challenging you and more about
                    exploring every nook and cranny, though they still offer some fun variation with weapons like a bow
                    and arrow that adds resistance to the adaptive triggers as you pull the string back, and a paintball
                    machine gun that sputters the DualSense with every fired round.

             <br>
                    Astro’s Playroom’s little details like that ensure the DualSense lives up its name –- it’s not just
                    called the DualTouch (which, let’s be frank, would be a terrible name) – genuinely making what I saw
                    on screen more immersive. In fact, the only use of the DualSense that seemed superfluous to me was
                    the microphone. I’ve seen uses like blowing into a mic to get an in-game fan to move since the days
                    of the original Nintendo DS, so it doesn’t necessarily bring anything all that fresh here.

                    <br>
                    Of course, it is worth mentioning that any DualSense uses here, and in all future games, likely can
                    and should never be the only way to experience a game. For many, simply holding the controller
                    through all its intense rumbling and trigger resistance could be difficult or damaging, while others
                    may not be able to hear what’s coming through the speaker. The PS5, at a system level, lets you shut
                    off or adjust the DualSense’s added feedback – and if you were to play without that feedback,
                    Astro’s Playroom is still a fun and at times challenging platformer with plenty to discover thanks
                    to its loads of collectable puzzle pieces and artifacts to uncover, a host of unlockable speedrun
                    levels to keep aiming for better times on, and an absolute abundance of PlayStation Easter eggs. It
                    certainly raises many questions for me about the necessity of what the DualSense has to offer, but I
                    can’t deny how enjoyable all of its bells and whistles are.

                    But the joy of Astro’s Playroom, while largely focused on its use of the new controller, is also
                    thanks to Team Asobi’s dedication to turning this pack-in into a mini-museum of PlayStation history.
                    The hidden puzzle pieces come together to form wall art murals tracing PlayStation console history
                    all the way back to the original, while each of the main four worlds hold hidden artifacts belonging
                    to the four respective eras of past PlayStation hardware. (And don’t worry PSP and Vita fans, you
                    aren’t forgotten.) Some of these are more expected pieces, like recreations of the DualShock 4 or
                    the PS2, but there are some appreciable deep cuts, like the PSP GPS plug-in, or throwbacks like the
                    PocketStation. All of them are put on display to be looked at or hit to produce sound effects, pop
                    open disc trays, and more.

                    <br>
                    As you’re exploring Playroom’s levels you’ll also stumble across Astro Bots wearing a blue cap and
                    holding a camera. That’s the signal for a reference to a PlayStation game, and levels are littered
                    with them – for example, you might find a boat with a robot inside that has a familiar tattoo, axe,
                    and BOY alongside it, or a larger robot head made up of many smaller ones in a nod to LocoRoco.
                    They’re mostly there for the fun of it all rather than to accumulate anything, but every single one
                    of them made me smile, even the few that I had to take a moment to try and guess at. I won’t spoil
                    any more here so as to not rob anyone of the joy of first discovering them. But, much like with the
                    hardware artifacts, every era of PlayStation is represented in some truly hilarious ways.

                    While hunting for realistic depictions of PlayStation systems or spotting a robot wearing the
                    costume of a beloved PlayStation mascot may stick out, it all feels of apiece with Astro’s charming
                    overall design. Running at a smooth 4K 60fps, Astro’s world may not be massive and require huge draw
                    distances or populate the screen with hundreds of enemies, but it’s certainly pretty. Natural
                    environments come together with PS5 internal parts and other pieces of hardware in a beautiful blend
                    of the environmental with the technological. A grassy plain looks beautiful in 4K, only for the
                    plants to be topped with PlayStation face button symbols rather than flowers. A rocky wall you need
                    to climb has cliffs jutting out that… are actually recreations of trigger buttons. It is yet another
                    sign of Team Asobi’s dedication to imbuing Astro with a sense of nostalgic fun when coming across
                    the many ways they insert PlayStation references into the world. And that’s on top of the way it
                    blends some audio Easter eggs into the world that are perhaps best discovered while playing.

                    <br>
                    Astro’s Playroom surprised and delighted me. This PS5 pack-in most certainly hues closer to a
                    technical showcase, essentially a loosely-structured sandbox to mess around in and discover what the
                    PS5 has to offer. But it has enough collectibles, creative ideas, and genuinely exciting uses of the
                    DualSense that PS5 owners shouldn’t brush this one aside in the launch lineup. After months and
                    months of hearing how the DualSense would immerse me like never before, Astro’s Playroom put
                    promises into practice and impressively proved what’s possible with the PS5’s new controller.
