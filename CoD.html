                After taking a year off in 2018, Call of Duty’s single-player campaign has come roaring back in the
                revival of the Modern Warfare name. For my money, this is the best campaign the series has seen since
                2010’s Black Ops; and if that sounds like a backhanded compliment, I don’t mean it as one. Though it
                stops short of being as provocative and button-pushing as it seemed poised to be, it is nevertheless an
                extremely well-designed first-person shooter that refreshes the franchise format just enough with a few
                cool new ideas and some smart new takes on others we haven’t seen in years.
                The plot of Modern Warfare’s rebooted storyline starts out trying to blur the lines between good and
                bad, but it ends up quickly establishing the good guys as very clearly good. The US team is led by
                memorably mustachioed fan-favorite Captain John Price, while the sister and brother duo of Farah and
                Hamir head up an insurgency movement fighting to push Russian forces out of their fictional home country
                of Urzikstan. That’s right: it’s cool to shoot at Russia again.

                <br>
                That’s not to say that uncomfortable, morally gray things don’t happen in this campaign; they do, and
                sometimes those events are directly in your control. Unarmed women die. Children are shot. Civilians can
                catch bullets. Suicide bombers are a threat. But even in Modern Warfare’s biggest moment – a showdown
                with a generically named enemy lieutenant called The Butcher – Infinity Ward wanders near the moral line
                but never actually steps up to or over it. That’s disappointing, because I’d really hoped this story
                would really have something meaningful to say about the soul-affecting nature of war in a time when the
                United States has been involved in so many conflicts for so long.

                Still, just because Modern Warfare doesn’t have a lot of bite behind its bark doesn’t mean it’s not a
                great action ride. It is one of the best linear first-person shooter campaigns I’ve played in a good
                while, thanks to an exciting pace across its five-ish-hour story that, notably, is always mixing up the
                gameplay. Sure, we’ve done the run-of-the-mill street battles a million times before in this series, but
                here you’re never doing them for very long without something unexpected happening. Modern Warfare
                delights most when it surprises, like when you have to engage in tense close-quarters combat to clean
                out the enemy from small, multi-story houses – often when it’s pitch-black outside of your night-vision
                goggles. Or when you fly explosive-rigged drones into enemy helicopters or paint targets for missile
                strikes.

                <br>
                <b>15. Call of Duty: Ghosts</b><br>
                Ghosts is set sometime in the near future and is centered around brothers Logan and Hesh who are tasked
                with taking down Gabriel Rorke, former head of the Ghosts - an elite squad of soldiers who their father
                was previously a part of. In our review, we said, “it's by no means an achievement in dramatic
                storytelling — it's more about dumb fun. The generic story is particularly crippled by a poor second
                act, and doesn’t explore anything that previous games in the series haven’t already done in some
                fashion. The only saving grace for Ghosts is Riley, your companion German Shepherd that sticks by your
                side.” Awww. But still, this is easily the most forgettable campaign in Call of Duty history.

                <br>
                <b>14. Call of Duty: Black Ops III</b><br>
                Black Ops III is unabashedly a sci-fi war story. Set in the year 2065, the world is in the midst of a
                third Cold War between the Winslow Accord and Common Defense Pact, two global alliances. However, in the
                future, most of the combat is handled by robots or cybernetic supersoldiers. Much of the story revolves
                around the concept of the Direct Neural Interface (DNI for short), which allows soldiers to interact
                with weapons and computers - as well as enemy soldiers - remotely. While these cool new combat mechanics
                were welcomed, the story ended up falling a bit short. In our review, we said “Black Ops 3 didn’t spend
                enough time [with] its characters before it tried to cash them in for an emotional payoff.”

                <br>
                <b>13. Call of Duty 3</b><br>
                The third entry in the WWII story arc, Call of Duty 3 mixes things up by giving players the opportunity
                to play through the campaign as one of four Allied countries: United States, Great Britain, Canada, or
                Poland. While being able to play from different perspectives is welcomed, COD3 doesn’t differ itself
                much from its predecessor and the limited scope of the campaign doesn’t make much of an impact overall.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>12. Call of Duty: Black Ops II</b><br>
                Alex Mason returns in Black Ops II, which features the series’ first branching narrative experience and
                introduces futuristic weaponry for the first time. Black Ops II continues the Cold War-era story from
                the previous entry, but also includes missions set in 2025, during the fictional second Cold War and
                stars Alex’s son, David. Everything is tied together by BO2’s antagonist, Raul Menendez, one of the
                series’ best villains to-date. The star, however, is the decision-based gameplay. As we highlighted in
                our review, “it’s a brilliant riff on the traditional Call of Duty campaign design, and, combined with
                the additional cutscenes that flesh out the story, creates a narrative worth replaying just to see the
                wildly different moments and endings.”

                <br>
                <b>11. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</b><br>
                Modern Warfare 3 picks up right where Modern Warfare 2’s final mission left off. Task Force 141 are
                still hunting Vladimir Makarov, the antagonist from MW2, as he orchestrates a series of terror attacks
                across Europe. While it was ultimately fine, wrapping up the arc begun in previous games, we said, “it
                isn't ultimately all that interesting or satisfying,” in our review.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>10. Call of Duty: WWII</b><br>
                Call of Duty: WWII returns to the series’ roots for the first time in almost a decade, opting for a more
                grounded, emotional story, and mostly succeeds. Over the course of the roughly five-hour campaign you
                start to create a bond with Private “Red” Daniels and his squad, but had it been a bit longer, it
                might’ve been more impactful. Where WWII does excel, though is in exploration of the human side of war.
                As we said in our review, “the squad isn’t trying to take down the biggest, baddest enemy they can find;
                they’re just trying to survive and do their best to make a difference as things get progressively worse.
                It’s a more human perspective than we’ve seen in recent years.”
                Meanwhile, the enemy AI is perfectly average. They’re not cannon fodder, but they don’t exactly rival
                Half-Life’s “flock” behavior either. I managed to break the AI once, when I went up a ladder straight to
                the third floor of a building, got noticed by a guy in the hallway outside the room I was in, and he
                yelled just before I gunned him down with my silenced shotgun. His yell summoned literally everyone else
                in the house, one by one, who I gunned down like fish in a barrel as soon as they appeared in the
                doorway.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another highlight was a boss fight of sorts in which you play as a child, and...well, I won’t say any
                more for spoiler reasons, but you can read about it in my original Modern Warfare preview if you like.
                It’s even got dialogue choices in key scenes, and those added a few welcome moments of feeling like I
                had a real impact on the story, even if you ultimately don’t.
                <br>
                <br>
                This Call of Duty even throws a smart curveball at you about halfway through by taking the gun out of
                your hands completely and switching to stealth as you guide a civilian through a terrorist-overrun
                embassy. In this sequence, you use the surveillance cameras to survey each room and tell her where and
                when to move over the phone. It’s something we’ve never seen in the series before, and it’s a clever
                flip of the script that helps make Modern Warfare more tense and interesting by taking the action down a
                notch or two so that it can then ratchet it up again for greater effect.

                <br>
                <br>
                But perhaps my favorite mission is also its biggest: an “All Ghillied Up” homage that has you and
                Captain Price skulking through a small town, silencers ready, taking out bad guys with single shots to
                the head. Thwip! The freedom to tackle the buildings in any order you choose makes it feel full of
                possibilities: you can take any entrance in each one, and optionally search the outside to find the
                electrical main to kill the lights and enhance your stealthy hunting capabilities. I savored every
                moment of that mission; I took out every last bad guy on the grounds and in the buildings, and I cut the
                power to every building. The original Modern Warfare was the first Call of Duty to learn that the quiet
                moments only helped enhance the loud ones and vice versa, and this reboot applies the lesson well.
                <br>
                <br>
                2019’s Modern Warfare is also stunningly gorgeous. The lighting – particularly in the outdoor forest
                areas at nighttime – looks dazzling, and it’s especially impressive on the characters themselves. These
                faces and their animations are among the most lifelike I’ve ever seen in a game. I know that sounds like
                hyperbole, but it’s not. These are some seriously impressive character models – and not just in
                cutscenes. Audio shines as well, particularly with thundering weapon sounds punctuated by the bouncing
                of expended bullet casings on the ground. Though I will note that, while I appreciated the multitude of
                sound option packages in the Audio Settings menu, I wasn’t completely happy with any of them using my
                Dolby-enabled Astro A40 headset. Thankfully, though, you can customize individual audio settings and
                aren’t just stuck with the presets. The point is: play it in 4K with a good sound setup if you can.

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Verdict</b>
                <br>
                As someone who’s played every single Call of Duty campaign and really missed it last year, the new
                Modern Warfare is exactly the kind of single-player revival I’ve been looking for. It introduces welcome
                new kinds of gameplay moments while executing familiar ones exceptionally well. Sure, its story may not
                be as provocative as it seems to want to be, but it reestablishes a strong identity for this 16-year-old
                franchise with a showcase solo shooter experience. Amidst a growing pile of battle royales and looter
                shooters that just don’t scratch that same itchy trigger finger, it felt just like old times.
