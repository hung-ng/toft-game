                    Stiff arming its way through the crowded battle royale genre, Fortnite
                    Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland military simulation vibe with
                    vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform building system that’s unlike anything else in competitive
                    multiplayer games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into the battle royale
                    genre that blew up last year that the basic description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100
                    players are dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of gathering weapons and
                    gear to become the last person or team left standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can’t
                    be mistaken for any other game because the vehicle you’re skydiving out of is, inexplicably, a
                    flying party bus – a nice change of pace from a drab military plane – and the place you land is a
                    giant, beautifully colorful island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, where an unlucky
                    circle could leave getting out of the encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite’s map is at
                    least small enough (relative to PUBG’s) that even if you have to run across the entire island to get
                    to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the storm you run very little risk of being killed by
                    the collapsing border.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with their own style of structures —
                    a quaint suburb of houses, a giant office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an
                    outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a whole has hundreds of buildings
                    with randomly spawning loot in the form of guns, explosives, and healing items.

                    <br>
                    Once you do find the weapons you’re looking for, most fights in Fortnite go about the same way: You
                    start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of
                    ending the fight before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster assault rifle or
                    tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle. While it’s far from the only way to play, this
                    combination seems to be the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation of
                    almost every fight in Fortnite.

                    It’s a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye with just one slight miss.
                    This makes for a stark contrast from other battle royale games like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds,
                    which is filled with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more than a single
                    well placed shot. It’s a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated than
                    simply aiming at your opponent and firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the
                    shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost automatic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate itself from every other battle
                    royale game and shows off what truly makes it special: The building.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant choice that sets Battle Royale
                    apart not just from other battle royale games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general.
                    Just about everything that isn’t the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel, which can be
                    used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the map (so long as some part of the structure
                    touches the ground). It’s a massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can
                    be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures that others around you have
                    created. But that’s one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.

                    <br>
                    With just three primary tiles – floors, walls, and stairs – the building toolset may seem limited,
                    but it’s got everything you really need. Whether it was building a staircase up to that
                    hard-to-reach loot chest or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an
                    attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at hand, and I could swap to
                    the piece I needed without missing a beat. In fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite
                    moves is placing one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in mid-air and
                    place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale vertical walls or go straight up a mountain.
                    While this may sound like an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost
                    anyone can pull it off – and they do, making it one of the most common tricks to getting around the
                    island.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first time I really understood how Fortnite’s building and shooting played into one another came
                    in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one of the map’s many cities. Another player and I were
                    sheepishly taking shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran out of
                    ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun – a weapon I had largely disregarded up
                    until this point. With the few resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent’s wall, jumped
                    off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine a play as it gets, but it
                    was an absolute revelation for me at the time. Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that
                    Fortnite Battle Royale is more about building than it is about shooting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious – like building stairs to get to the
                    roof of a building, or making a wall to block an enemy’s shots – the system also gives you room to
                    think outside the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can’t help yet, or create a
                    decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you wait behind a tree. The system even provides
                    some elegant solutions to getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale
                    genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no problem – just make your own
                    bridge to the other side.

                        One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of forcing me toward his
                        waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.

                    <br>
                    Thanks to the building system’s simple but robust design, you can throw structures together in a way
                    that suits your style. While some people love high towers that stretch into the sky, I like to keep
                    things at a lower altitude, giving me more room to bounce between my platforms and the ground. One
                    player I faced lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways, with doors that led to nothing, all
                    in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
                    Creative uses of building become even more apparent in the heat of battle. With every building
                    decision made in a split second, every player develops their own unique techniques. Where one person
                    might build a wall, another builds stairs they can use to rush forward. When I might create a window
                    in the middle of my wall to take an extra shot, someone else might try to flank around the side of
                    the building by adding a new section entirely. What might start as a simple staircase at the
                    beginning of a small fight between me and another person could morph into a twisted modern art spire
                    as more people join in and add their own pieces. Fortnite’s building mechanic is an incredible
                    system that allows for personal expression in a way that really isn’t present in many other
                    competitive games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While building is a freeform system, there’s an invisible grid that exists around the entire island
                    that helps every piece that you build snap into place, and it works almost flawlessly. Of the
                    hundreds of structures I’ve placed, it was rare that even one piece landed where I wasn’t expecting,
                    and I’ve never gotten myself stuck or killed as a result. That’s a pleasant surprise, considering
                    how much building happens during chaotic firefights.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of this adds up to a system that is simply a joy to use. Everytime a fight broke out I’d get a
                    spark of excitement as I started to think about how I would fight and build my way out of the
                    situation at the same time. Quickly doing the math to determine if I had enough resources to build a
                    staircase for a daring rush toward my enemy adds an extra mental thrill to combat. Every new plan
                    felt like I was learning more about Fortnite Battle Royale and the way it would let me play – even
                    if most of them ended with a shotgun in the face, it’s how that shotgun got to that face that
                    mattered.

                    Even if you find something that works, you can’t get complacent because part of the beauty of
                    Fortnite Battle Royale is its constant state of upheaval. Epic has shown a willingness to make big
                    changes to the weapon hierarchy overnight. Maybe in the next patch, snipers will replace shotguns as
                    the go-to weapon class and the simple staircases and bridges of today will give way to the grandiose
                    sniping fortresses of tomorrow as building tactics change to match the new weapon balance. That’s
                    how Fortnite Battle Royale has overcome one of the biggest challenges for any battle royale game:
                    Keeping up with the demand from its community for new and exciting gameplay and cosmetic additions.
                    The pace of new content has also been impressive. Since Fortnite Battle Royale’s earliest release in
                    July of 2017 Epic has made countless additions, from new towns and cities on the map to brand-new
                    game modes, like the massive 50-vs-50 team mode from earlier this year or a recent patch’s Blitz
                    mode, which has already become a fan favorite thanks to its speeder resource gathering and higher
                    frequency of loot spawns.

                    <br>
                    Even Fortnite Battle Royale’s free-to-play structure feels a step ahead of the competition. Every
                    item offered in the in-game store is strictly cosmetic, like character skins and new pickax designs.
                    There’s a daily shop, where the selection of wares refreshes every 24 hours, and a legendary shop
                    that updates every week or so with items that are likely to never return, like the particularly
                    gaudy pink bear costume for Valentine’s Day or the extremely detailed Wukong skin that was released
                    as a part of Fortnite’s Chinese New Year celebration. But the biggest microtransaction available in
                    Fortnite Battle Royale is the Battle Pass, a one-time, $10 purchase that gives you access to 100
                    tiers of rewards that unlock as you play and complete unique challenges. It’s a neat structure that
                    keeps you constantly working toward the next big milestone.
                    The influx of huge and constant gameplay changes may seem haphazard or dangerous when so many people
                    already love it, running the risk of fixing what ain’t broke. But so far, Epic’s been smart enough
                    about it to make people work to adjust their tactics while also avoiding the loss of the things that
                    make Fortnite Battle Royale fun.

                    The only downside to all of these interlocking mechanics is the initial learning curve. Though each
                    mechanic is simple on its own, making sense of them all together is a bit of a challenge –
                    especially when there isn’t much of a tutorial to speak of. In fact, outside of a few pieces of
                    text, Fortnite Battle Royale mostly leaves you with simple trial-and-error and watching YouTube
                    videos until you’re able to figure out what makes it tick. For most of us, that means the first
                    dozen or so trips out of the Battle Bus are likely to be pretty painful (and often very short)
                    experiences. But, if you stick with it, all the systems start to click.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That’s Fortnite Battle Royale’s ultimate reward for the process of learning: An immense freedom that
                    allows for a hundred solutions to tackle any problem, and none of them are just right or just wrong.
                    This is the rare game where each loss fills me with more determination to improve than
                    disappointment, and each death comes with a quick realization of what went wrong and where. I’m
                    constantly left eager to queue up for another match and try to correct previous mistakes — it
                    doesn’t hurt that the time between dying and dropping out of the Battle Bus again never takes more
                    than 60 seconds, thanks to Fortnite’s speedy matchmaking and enormous pool of players.

                        Fortnite Battle Royale runs fantastically on every platform I played it on.

                    The first couple of matches are all about the pursuit of tasting the first victory, or Victory
                    Royale, as Fortnite calls it. Achieving it and seeing the tepid fanfare that accompanies it,
                    however, ends up feeling like a bit of a letdown. But the feat of beating 99 other players is the
                    true victory, and personal satisfaction is more than enough to make up for the bland winner screen.
                    Suddenly, every game I dropped into felt winnable, and my drive to keep improving grew even more
                    intense. Whether it was my first win, my fifth, or my twenty-fifth, the sense of excitement from a
                    well-played game never leaves. This was twice as true in duo or squad games, when the lackluster
                    victory screen becomes merely a backdrop to the shouts of my friends as they boast about their
                    incredible shots and recount their closest calls.
                    It’s also important to mention that Fortnite Battle Royale runs fantastically on every platform I
                    played it on (iOS, PS4, Xbox One, and PC), never stuttering or dropping frames even in middle of
                    tense fights. That’s crucial for the speed of building that it demands, and a distinctive advantage
                    over its chief rival in the battle royale genre, PUBG, which has more than its fair share of

                    That list of platforms includes mobile, which is highly impressive in that it’s exactly the same
                    game as its console counterparts – to the point where cross-play between PC, Xbox One, and mobile is
                    possible. Even on a device that fits in your pocket, Fortnite Battle Royale still looks fantastic,
                    even if it’s running at a slightly lower resolution than it would on most other platforms. The only
                    real difference is the controls, which, for a mobile game, aren’t terrible. In fact, I could pull
                    off almost all of the same movements I could on PC as on my phone – at about a quarter of the speed.
                    Playing with other mobile users, and thereby operating with exactly the same speed disadvantage,
                    really does feel like playing a slightly slower version of Fortnite Battle Royale. So, while aiming
                    and building skills don’t exactly translate on mobile devices, the iOS version is a great
                    alternative for anyone who doesn’t have access to the console or PC versions – or if you just want
                    to play on the go.

                    Mastering Fortnite Battle Royale’s many systems is worth every second of investment. Whether you go
                    it alone or queue up with a squad, even if you’re the first to die or you actually manage to earn
                    the Victory Royale, Fortnite’s zany style and unique blend of shooting and building almost never
                    offers anything less than an outstanding time. It may not be the first battle royale game, and it
                    certainly won’t be the last, but Fortnite sets itself apart from the crowd by giving you the freedom
                    and tools to express your own personal playstyle.
