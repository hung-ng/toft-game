                    In the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, a poor soul is doomed to forever push a boulder uphill
                    without rest. Each time he’d push it up, it would roll back down again and he’d have to start anew.
                    But what if that Herculean climb uphill was actually awesome combat against a randomized variety of
                    enemies as you fight your way out of Hell, with a wide range of godly powers that grow and combine
                    in interesting ways as you progress? And what if, instead of going back to zero, you got a little
                    stronger each time with some help from a colorful cast of allies and enemies who remember each of
                    your attempts? That’s Hades’ premise, and the Greek mythology-themed rogue-lite that developer
                    Supergiant has built around it makes going to Hell a joy.
<br>
<br>
                    The journey of Zagreus, son of Hades, through the labyrinthine Underworld toward the freedom of the
                    mortal realm unfolds from an isometric perspective as you take on hordes of colorfully animated
                    undead that fill the screen with danger in every randomly ordered room you pass through.
                    Fortunately, Zag is a skilled warrior capable of wielding six different weapons, each with four
                    different variants. Each of these Infernal Arms is geared to complement a certain playstyle. Want to
                    get in the thick of it and wreck some demons? Then consider the straightforward Stygian Blade.
                    Prefer to peck at foes from a safe distance? Then channel your inner Artemis and use the bow. Later
                    you’ll unlock a bashing shield, a spear, and more, and each plays significantly differently,
                    creating one of many layers of replayability for Hades.
                    <br>
                    <br><p class="quote">
                    Regardless of your weapon of choice, Zag can use a dash to dart out of trouble or to get into a more
                    advantageous position. And let me tell you -- few things in life are as satisfying as a successful
                    last-second dodge that sets you up for stabbing an enemy in the back for bonus damage.
                    Almost inevitably, the forces of Hades will overwhelm you.
                    “
                    </p>
                    <br>
<br>
                    The final mechanic in Zag’s moveset is the cast: a skill-shot based projectile that fires a red
                    jewel into an enemy for a quick burst of damage. The jewel embeds itself into a target,
                    disqualifying you from firing another cast until you kill the enemy and retrieve your ammunition, so
                    shooting it at the biggest, meanest enemy in the room isn’t always the best idea. As with each one
                    of Zag's moves, using it well involves a delicate balance between risk and reward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Almost inevitably, though, the forces of Hades will overwhelm you eventually, and every death sends
                    Zag back home to start over from scratch, save for persistent currencies and progress in
                    relationships with the wonderful cast of characters who inhabit the Underworld, from lord Hades
                    himself all the way down. So you’re going to be spending a lot of time getting to know everyone --
                    and it’s time very well spent.

                    Zag is a rebellious heartthrob trying to find his place in the world between Hades and Mount
                    Olympus. His sympathetic coming-of-age story brought me in, but I fell in love with his
                    tongue-in-cheek musings on the world around him and snarky back-and-forth with the disembodied voice
                    of the Narrator.

                    <br>
<br>
                    But the heart and soul of Hades, outside of its combat, lies in Zag’s interaction with various
                    deities and mythic figures from Greek myth, like Achilles, Orpheus, and more. It turns out that
                    adding a dash of dating simulator mechanics to a rogue-lite was the secret sauce in making good use
                    of a large cast of interesting characters. Each personality feels like an authentic reinterpretation
                    of a classic Greek myth, and they’re all a joy to behold. For instance, instead of painting Sisyphus
                    as a tragic character, he's an optimist who you encounter on a break while the gods aren’t watching.
                    Even his boulder (affectionately known as Bouldy) sports a carved smile that reacts in silence upon
                    interaction. Investing in Zag’s relationships with each character paves the way for interesting
                    backstory reveals, world-building, new sidequests, or even items to assist on your future escape
                    attempts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not only are conversations and side stories actively engaging -- attempting to reunite Achilles with
                    his life-long partner, Patroclus, or Orpheus with his long-lost muse Euridice, are genuinely moving
                    and hearken back to the kind of melodrama the ancient Greeks were so good at -- there are also
                    gameplay benefits! Advancing these relationships far enough grants you persistent keepsakes and
                    companions, which are both invaluable tools in aiding Zag's quest to run away from home. Of course,
                    not all keepsakes are as useful as others; given the choice between the Lucky Tooth that grants you
                    an additional chance at life if you’re killed or Olympic keepsakes that increase your chance at
                    better drops, I’m going with a second life every time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Something that’s truly special and unusual about Hades is that Supergiant Games uses these
                    persistent relationships to travel the difficult path of marrying story to gameplay, and in doing so
                    elevates the simple loop of Zag's escape into something more than the sum of its parts. Within the
                    world of most rogue-lites, a failed run is not typically seen as part of the story (with apologies
                    to Rogue Legacy). But in Hades, a death leads to Zag returning home to mockery (usually from Papa
                    Hades). This transforms something as fundamental as death from a video game-y failure state into
                    in-game world building. Characters remember your triumphs and failures with a staggering amount of
                    incidental dialogue that made me feel like I was constantly chipping away at new content within
                    Zagreus’ story even when I failed. After a while I no longer feared death, I embraced it as an
                    opportunity to learn and revist friends back in the House of Hades to see if they have something new
                    to say.

                    Losing the fear of death is important, because you’re going to do a lot of dying. I didn’t manage a
                    successful escape until attempt 31 (which I hear is roughly the average...I hope). Fortunately,
                    while things with the citizens of the Underworld might be complicated, Zag’s aunts, uncles, and
                    cousins up on Olympus are eager to assist his rebellion thanks in equal part to genuine familial
                    care and wanting to rub Lord Hades’ nose in it if you eventually succeed. Their aid comes in the
                    form of boons (run-specific tokens from the gods that grant Zag godly power-ups) that modify to
                    Zag’s abilities, making every run feel new and unique. Some are smaller, min-max stat-worthy
                    benefits that often feel like a daily vitamin -- you’re not sure you notice the difference they make
                    as you play, but they stack up over time and make all the behind-the-scenes numbers larger in your
                    favor, so it’s probably a good thing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And of course, during each run you also build your relationships with the Gods of Olympus by
                    offering them tokens of appreciation in the form of nectar and ambrosia that you collect, which also
                    grant you access to their own collection of keepsakes and up the chances of receiving rare, epic,
                    and heroic variants of their boons with progressively better stats.

                    Those familiar with Greek myth are already aware of the fickle nature of the gods.Every now and
                    then, treks through Hades present Zag with a Trial of the Gods, a chamber that allows you to select
                    one of two different deities to commune with. Poseidon may be your bestie early on in your quest,
                    but choose Dionysus over him in a later Trial and he won’t hesitate to make your life a living hell
                    in this particular chamber. Your reward, should you survive, is possessing two different boons at
                    once as opposed to the typical one.

                    I rolled credits on Hades at approximately 48 hours and I’m still met with new storylines,
                    challenges, and side stories to tackle -- and a peak at the achievement list teases an epilogue I’ve
                    yet to discover how to unlock.

                    <b>The Music of Hades</b>
                    <br>
                    Supergiant Games is known for its musical craft: Bastion’s somber tones of a world lost,
                    Transistor’s lounge-singer popstar lyrics soaked in sorrow, and Pyre’s epic poem-esque melodies are
                    a constant in my Spotify playlist. It should surprise no one that the music of Hades is unlike any
                    of those, but still of the same caliber as composer Darren Korb’s memorable compositions. Hades is a
                    blend of Rock n’ Lute, a melodic partnership between old and new that always pumps me up for my next
                    journey through the Underworld. A lot of the music is diegetic, meaning it exists within the world
                    of Hades, in that it’s usually sung as a hymn from the legendary musician Orpheus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the same time, Hades’ score is decidedly understated relative to Supergiant’s previous games, but
                    it all comes together to serve the tone and characters of the underworld. I think the highest
                    compliment I can pay to the Hades soundtrack is that it simply belongs. I didn’t know what Euridice
                    the Muse sounded like, but hearing her sing a lonely tune in an alcove of Asphodel just felt right.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Verdict</b>
                    <br>
                    Hades is a one-of-a-kind rogue-lite that sets the bar for creatively combining wildly different
                    genres together and using their strengths to complement each other in unexpected ways. Its blend of
                    satisfying, twitch-based action with countless modifiers to build replayability, dating
                    simulator-esque character interactions, and turning failure into a thing you look forward to as a
                    means of progressing the story coalesce to an experience that is more than the sum of its parts.
                    Hades skillfully navigates the millenia-old baggage of ancient characters, reinterpreted through a
                    contemporary lens that feels like they’re straight out of some animated series that’s way ahead of
                    its time. I’m now over 50 hours in, 70 escape attempts deep and I can’t stop thinking about my next
                    trip to Hell. Hades is an experience I never want to end.
