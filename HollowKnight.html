                It’s not hard to get lost in the deep, subterranean world of Hollow Knight – and I mean that in more
                ways than one. The expansive catacombs of Hallownest have countless paths to explore and secrets to
                find. But more than that, it’s rich with lore, history, and purpose that drew me into a 2D Metroidvania
                kingdom I wanted to uncover every inch of.
                <br>
                <br>
                The deeper I went into Hollow Knight, the more I was surprised at just how much content and freedom it
                has to offer. I could wander in basically any direction and find bosses to fight, upgrades to collect,
                and secrets to uncover. But what’s truly captivating about the exploring this long-dead kingdom is its
                atmosphere. Art, music, color tone, sound, and a million other little details combine to give each area
                of the map a distinct sense of place, and those areas jigsaw together in a way that feels intentional
                and alive.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>World Wide Web</b>
                <br>
                There are far more of these distinct biomes than I ever expected to discover, and the edges of each one
                blend together with the next in ways that help them make sense in the world. For example, walls on the
                border of the Fungal Wastes, even impassable ones in other areas, will be dotted with its telltale
                mushrooms. The lush environment of an area called Greenpath feels bustling and humid, a stark difference
                to the cold, dark caves of the Forgotten Crossroads. The bubble-filled region of Fog Canyon isn’t
                technically underwater, but the muffled filter over all of its audio goes hand-in-hand with jellyfish
                enemies and a brighter blue tone.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hallownest’s capital city, the City of Tears, is a metropolis in a huge cave where it’s always raining.
                But it wasn’t until 10 hours after I first discovered this place that I stumbled across the Blue Lake, a
                massive body of serene water positioned just above the underground city. Hollow Knight doesn’t shove
                this connection in your face, it just lets you explore its world and piece together the story for
                yourself as you sit down and enjoy a moment of quiet.
                <br>

                <br>
                In fact, Hollow Knight tells you very little about what’s going on, and instead sends you into a world
                full of monumental events that all happened long before you arrived: wars and heroes, love and culture,
                disease and destruction. The aftermath of Hallownest’s troubled past is left for you to discover and
                comes through loud and clear, but only if you take the time to listen. It’s told in a very subtle way,
                but teaches you so much about Hallownest in the process that I feel like I could practically write a
                book on it.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s a tragic tale, one full of fallen heroes and terrible decisions, but it still manages to make time
                for beautiful, calm, and hopeful moments throughout. And it’s easy to enjoy those moments, because
                Hollow Knight’s hand-drawn art is simply beautiful. It’s a world that manages to feel cohesive despite
                its citizens being adorable bug-people in a dying cave.
                <br>
                <br>
                The story (and your place in it) is picked up as you go. Some of it through dialogue with the adorable
                and quirky characters who still reside in this decrepit kingdom, some through important story events,
                and some just by observing your surroundings and the clues strewn about it. After my second playthrough,
                I have a fairly clear picture of Hallownest’s history, but it’s a picture I assembled myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                As much as I genuinely loved being pushed out of the boat and told to start kicking, Hollow Knights’
                first few hours can be a predictably sink-or-swim experience as a result. It’s an unashamedly
                challenging game that does a great job of silently teaching you how to play, but it still felt a little
                bit daunting to start — especially when death means having to fight your way back to your corpse to
                reclaim your money, called Geo.
                <br>
                <br>
                You have to find a map seller named Cornifer in each area before you can start keeping track of where
                you’ve been, and even then you have to equip a specific charm to see where you are on it in real time.
                That, coupled with fact that getting good at the combat takes practice, means I spent my first couple
                hours just trying to figure Hollow Knight out.
                <br>
                <br>
                But once I picked up the rhythm of its combat and the pattern of exploring its initially restrictive
                cave systems, Hollow Knight clicked in a way that made me never want to put it down. After Greenpath,
                the second major area, you reach a point where there’s no clear “correct” direction anymore. Like any
                Metroidvania, your path options are gated behind things like ledges too high to reach or gaps too far to
                jump until you find the necessary upgrades, but there are enough options that don’t result in dead ends
                to keep to you exploring for quite a while.

                <br>
                <br>
                Hidden around the Kingdom of Hallownest are traditional Metroidvania abilities like a dash and a wall
                climb to help you better navigate its caves and reach new places. These new movement abilities also
                allow you to move through new paths in familiar terrain faster and more efficiently, giving the
                obligatory need to retread old ground (which does happen a fair amount) fresh life. Suddenly your wall
                climb turns that small gap between platforms into a shortcut instead of a hazard.

                Thankfully, there is also a flavor-filled quick-travel system called the Stagways. Stag stations can be
                found and unlocked across Hallownest, allowing you to call The Last Stag to take you between them. What
                could just be a jump between points instead becomes a quest in itself, and I almost always spoke to The
                Stag after unlocking a station not to travel, but to hear his gruff but optimistic take on whatever new
                stop I brought him to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hollow Knight’s world also undergoes more concrete changes as you progress. Railways and elevators will
                unlock permanently, opening shortcuts that loop back to earlier sections and easing the burden of
                backtracking. One early area eventually even morphs into a much harder late-game section in a way that
                makes it feel like your actions in Hallownest have real weight.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Hammer Meets Nail</b>
                <br>
                The combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky as you learn to time
                quick directional sword slashes with jumps and dashes. It rewards patience and skill massively — killing
                enemies is a matter of sharp timing, learning attack patterns, and having quick reflexes more than just
                the upgrades you earn along the way. You can find upgrades to your weapon damage, increase your max
                health, and equip charms with a variety of abilities, but more importantly, I just got better as I went.
                A boss that gave me tons of trouble at the start of the game was a pushover when I returned for a second
                playthrough.
                <br>
                <br>
                And while your timing requires precision, the combat itself is somewhat forgiving. Hitting enemies lets
                you collect a resource called Soul which you can stop and channel at any time to heal, as long as you
                don’t get hit. So while the all-or-nothing nature of dropping your Geo on death gives exploration a
                sweaty-palmed tension, Hollow Knight also gives you the tools to take a breath, gather Soul, and get
                your health back up.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are a decent amount of smaller enemies scattered around each level as well, acting as weaker
                baddies that let you recover Soul and collect Geo in relative safety. But there are just as many scary
                opponents too, and dying far from a checkpoint is a real risk. The enemy variety is impressive to say
                the least, with nearly 100 different types to fight, and even ones with similar behaviors looking
                dramatically different depending on what area of the map you find them in.
                <br>
                <br>
                A charm system allows you to customize your own methods for killing those enemies as well. Each charm
                takes up a set number of notches (which you can earn more of along the way) and range from small
                effects, like extending your attack distance or gathering more Soul on hits, to large trade-off changes,
                like doubling your health but preventing you from healing at all, which can dramatically change how you
                play.

                <br>
                <br>
                Thankfully, you can freely swap them out whenever you sit at a bench, which also serve as Hollow
                Knight’s save points and healing stations. That meant I could come up with specific combinations to
                counter different scenarios on the fly. I had my favorite loadout for general use, a loadout that upped
                the amount of Geo I got and collected it automatically, and a loadout for moving more quickly. If you
                prefer using Hollow Knight’s Soul-consuming damage abilities instead of swinging your sword (called a
                Nail) you could equip charms that increase Soul damage and even change your attacks entirely.
                <br>
                <br>
                For some harder boss fights that didn’t give me an opportunity to heal, my loadout even shifted to
                maximizing my temporary health at the cost of unequipping charms I had grown to rely on. Through all
                that experimentation, it never felt like there was a wrong choice. All the charms are good, and they all
                work, and it’s up to you to determine which you like the most and which work best for the scenario in
                front of you.
                <br>
                <br>
                And if any situation will push you to test those choices out, it will likely be one of Hollow Knight’s
                copious amount of boss fights. Seriously: there are dozens of different bosses, ranging from small and
                quick enemies to large, deadly brutes. These contained challenges are some of the best thrills available
                because they force you to find a strategy, learn when it’s safe to attack or heal, and get better each
                time you get crushed
                <br>
                <br>
                Because believe me, you will get crushed. Those hard losses occasionally slowed my momentum, but there
                is almost always some other path to explore. If I was having trouble pushing through in one direction,
                I’d just wander down another until I got stronger (or just better) and decided to face that tough fight
                again.

                <b>Soul-Searching For Secrets</b>
                <br>
                In fact, a staggering amount of Hollow Knight’s best content is entirely optional. You could probably
                beat the campaign without seeing two-thirds of what it has to offer, though the quest to get an
                alternate (and much better) ending will pull you in front of significantly more. Bosses, thoughtful
                story, and whole sections of the map can remain hidden, which adds to that feeling of actually exploring
                this world when you do stumble upon them.

                The key here is that none of this optional content feels like filler. I actively wanted to find every
                secret I possibly could and learn what was actually going on in the story. It all felt unique,
                significant, and wonderfully put together. Even after the 30+ hours it took me to truly beat Hollow
                Knight, I was excited to go back for more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having so much to do at any given time can admittedly be overwhelming at points. There can be so many
                open paths on your map that the burden of deciding which to explore next can make you doubt which is the
                “right” way. But the beauty of Hallownest is that there is very rarely a right or wrong choice, and it’s
                unlikely two players will explore these caves in the same order.

                <br>
                <br>

                Hollow Knight has also been getting free post-launch content updates since its launch on PC last year,
                all of which are included on Switch (and more updates are on the way, according to developer Team
                Cherry). Those patches have added new areas and new bosses, and one even added the ability to add custom
                markers to your map. The simple act of being able to visually track when I need to revisit an area or
                which paths I’ve yet to go down is a godsend. It has helped me take stock of what needs to be done
                alongside the other late-game amenities Hollow Knight makes available for completionists, like maps that
                will eventually track certain collectibles.
                <br>
                <br>
                But so much of what’s worth finding past the point where you can “beat” Hollow Knight is pure,
                concentrated lore. To really get a picture of what you’re doing (and to properly inform an important
                choice you have to make) you need to explore. I love that those key moments in the story tie into some
                of the best gameplay challenges it has to offer as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, one of the final secret areas basically transforms Hollow Knight into a Super Meat
                Boy-style platformer with very little combat. Platforming challenges exist all throughout the world,
                with some of the most thrilling requiring you to use your Nail as a pogo stick while you bounce across
                spikes, Duck Tales-style — but this area is something else entirely, and tells you about the history of
                that location with its themes.
                <br>
                <br>
                And, as I mentioned before, the music adds to that setting and art one thousand times over. While each
                location has its own theme and boss fight music, individual melodies and instruments will shift in and
                out as you move from screen to screen. The mood and tension of a scene are often driven by that music,
                and the soundtrack has quickly become one of my favorites.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Verdict</b>
                <br>
                Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover that’s as deep as its labyrinthine
                caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on
                your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about
                discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s
                worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.
