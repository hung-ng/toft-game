                    After four years and one IGN Game of the Year Award, Overwatch has evolved into a multiplayer
                    shooter that remains at the top of the class. It’s a dizzying amalgam of unique character design,
                    stunningly realised style, and compellingly dynamic action. Minutes turn into hours as you’re caught
                    up in round after magically exciting round, surrounded by gorgeously crafted maps packed with detail
                    and charm. Overwatch, simply put, is the most fun I’ve ever had playing a video game.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overwatch’s gameplay has remained almost entirely unchanged since launch and centres around taking
                    and controlling points on the map or escorting payloads from one end of them to the other, all at
                    the expense of the enemy team’s health bars. It’s a simple setup and not an altogether original one,
                    but it’s the nuance found in how you go about winning each match that makes Overwatch so brilliant.
                    Each team of six can be stitched together from the current pool of 32 heroes. Not only does each
                    play differently and bring their own tricks to the party, but they also affect the other heroes on
                    the ever-expanding roster with each new addition. Overwatch is a game bursting with character, not
                    least displayed in the characters themselves. Blizzard has created a world where anything goes and
                    everything flourishes.

                    The robust Reinhardt harks from a high fantasy setting familiar from past Blizzard titles. The
                    cyber-drenched Sombra is science-fiction incarnate and wouldn’t look out of place on the streets of
                    Night City. Then there’s the wise and occasionally wild Winston, who could pass as a gorilla
                    cosplaying as beast from X-Men. The beauty of Overwatch is that all of these different characters
                    feel right at home and not simply copy and pasted from other media. They’re lovingly designed as
                    both individuals and a unit, their interactions between each other before and during matches
                    providing entertainment aside from the combat unfurling.

                    <br>
                    Most recently, Echo, Overwatch’s final hero (until Overwatch 2), has joined the party. She’s an
                    airborne AI that darts through the sky, dealing damage with her powerful arsenal of advanced
                    weaponry. She’s a really fun character to play, but not without a level of risk attached as she is
                    vulnerable to accurate hitscan heroes like McCree or Soldier: 76, and can lose all of her 200HP in
                    the blink of an eye.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her ultimate, Duplicate, is a real game-changer though. It allows her to take the form of any member
                    of the opposite team and use all of their abilities, and can even charge up their ultimate at a far
                    speedier rate. Being able to clone an enemy Mercy, thus having two powerful healers on your side,
                    can turn the tide in a game and harkens back to the very early days where multiples of the same hero
                    were allowed on a team. It’s somewhat fitting that the last addition to the roster echoes back to
                    how Overwatch was originally played.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Penultimate addition Sigma, an eccentric Dutch astrophysicist tank, proved difficult to counter at
                    first, especially when paired with Orisa to create a double-barrier hellscape. His persistently
                    moving shield can be a problem to anyone looking to deal damage at range with blasts of Ashe’s rifle
                    or rain fire from above as the rocket launcher-wielding Pharah. This is just another puzzle to
                    solve, though, and his introduction saw a noticeable rise in the amount of closer-quarter
                    specialists, such as Doomfist and Reaper, appearing on the battlefield. As a result, I found myself
                    enjoying stringing together combos as Doomfist, a character I had hardly touched before Sigma’s
                    arrival, and unleashing a rocket punch into the side of an unsuspecting enemy. It just feels so much
                    better than when you’re on the end of one.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    This is in essence the beauty of Overwatch. It offers choice in abundance, and if it ever approaches
                    becoming stale I try out another hero and everything feels completely fresh again. I’ve put an
                    amount of time that would disgust many into mastering Hanzo’s bow and arrow skill set, but when I
                    found myself tiring of him slightly I decided to transfer my sniping skills over to Ana and healed
                    my teammates instead, providing a different form of satisfaction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even after 700 hours played, there are still characters that I’m not overly familiar with and some
                    that I look forward to losing time with in the future, even if I’ve resigned myself to never being
                    able to pull off a mildly successful Dragon Blade as Genji. Not every character is for everyone
                    though, and that’s absolutely fine and, to an extent, the point of Overwatch.

                    To call Overwatch a “shooter” almost seems reductive at this point. Yes, it’s firmly grounded in
                    solid first-person shooting mechanics, but there’s a vast arsenal of weaponry on display, ranging
                    from the clunkingly medieval to the clinically futuristic and even beyond science, stepping into the
                    fantastical. At times these worlds combine to create heroes that feel like they could only be
                    conceived in the Overwatch arena. This is exemplified best in some of the characters introduced
                    since launch. Brigitte, with her centuries-old mace that’s partnered with an energy shield that
                    feels airlifted from a different era of existence. The geneticist, Moira, who can summon biotic orbs
                    from her palms and then evade all incoming damage by fading onto an ethereal plane. Then there’s
                    Wrecking Ball, a maniacal hamster that rolls around in a spherical mech of death flanked by two
                    chattering machine guns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Crucially, the full roster of heroes – including those that’ve been added since launch – are
                    available to all from the get go and not hidden behind any form of pay wall or gated by progression,
                    meaning it doesn’t fall foul to systems that other games such as Rainbow Six Siege and Apex Legends
                    do by making you pay to unlock more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Soldier: 76 is as close to a standard character you’ll see in any other shooter as any of them,
                    while Mercy – although not as essential a healer as she once was – is also a great jumping in point
                    for rookies because she can hang back out of danger and support allies. Yes, some will take longer
                    to learn and, until you do, will be much less effective when you jump into a match. Zarya’s
                    seemingly straightforward combo of particle beam cannon and barriers can seem inviting at first due
                    to the comparative lack of abilities at her disposal, but using her well takes a lot of match
                    awareness and knowledge of teammate positioning. Her ultimate ability, Graviton Surge, can be
                    devastating once mastered and provides optimal synergy opportunities as you watch a Tracer clean up
                    with a pulse bomb and inevitably steal your Play of The Game – the automatically chosen moment of a
                    match that’s replayed for everybody at the end. Watching back these game-changing moments still
                    offers a unique sense of satisfaction even after the hundreds I must have been awarded by now, and
                    never fails to put a smile on my face, even to this day.

                    By far the biggest fundamental change to happen to Overwatch during its four year lifespan, however,
                    is the recently introduced role-lock system – something that had been long in demand. In standard
                    Quick Play and Competitive modes, you are now forced to select which role you’d like to play in the
                    team – damage, support, or tank – before starting the match. Each team is composed of two players of
                    each class and what you may lose in flexibility during the match (there are still well over 50,000
                    team composition permutations available), you gain in a more satisfying all-around experience. For
                    all of those moments you may spend wishing you could quickly switch off of support to dislodge a
                    troublesome Widowmaker sniper with D.Va, you get so many more moments of gratifying team play. Gone
                    are the days of being stuck on quintuple-stacked DPS squads as you scramble around a map looking for
                    a health pack and your jealous eyes gaze over to the opposition's fully formed comp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have to admit that I was sceptical of role queue when it was first announced, but I couldn’t be
                    happier to have been wrong. A level of flexibility has been lost and yes, it can be a little
                    annoying to have to wait up to eight minutes at times to get into a game if damage is your chosen
                    speciality, but as someone who’s willing and able to fill any role on a team it isn’t a great issue
                    to me. After all, if the chaos of old is what you are craving then classic Quick Play still exists
                    in the Arcade section of the menu for that dose of anarchic nostalgia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The other arcade modes haven’t changed greatly over the years, but what exists there on a rotational
                    basis can offer a welcome change of pace. None of them come close to achieving the point capturing
                    and payload delivering that the core game modes do, but that is purely down to those being so damn
                    good. Mystery Heroes mode, for example, can be a great place to learn new characters because you
                    respawn as someone different every time you die. Total Mayhem is a personal favourite: health is
                    doubled and cooldowns are halved, and the resulting absolute chaos and completely lives up to its
                    name.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    In every mode, moment-to-moment gameplay is enhanced by phenomenal sound design that functions in
                    both incidental and informative ways. Each piece of damage you receive has its own subtle noise
                    attached: I can tell instantly if a Genji is near me flinging shuriken into my side, or if it’s the
                    wasp-like Tracer needling fire into my back. It works both ways as well. There’s a distinct
                    satisfaction to the thwomp of Reinhardt’s hammer making contact with anyone daring to stand in its
                    way. Similarly, the metallic plonk of landing a headshot as Hanzo may be my single favourite sound
                    effect in any game.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overwatch doesn’t stop pumping useful information into your ears there, because the contextual voice
                    lines that echo across the plethora of maps go a long way toward giving you the info you need. The
                    way turrets are pointed out by teammates is chief among these, as well as passive-aggressive nudges
                    reminding you to push the payload rather than chase down a scampering Lucio for a selfish kill. It
                    says a lot about how good these audio cues are that Overwatch doesn’t feel like it’s missing a ping
                    system to communicate with teammates if you don’t have a mic, and although being on voice chat will
                    definitely aid in coordinating attacks, you can play alone happily without much detriment to the
                    overall experience. Steps have also been taken by Blizzard to counter the toxicity seen early on in
                    its lifespan. While never being able to eradicate it completely, systems such as the endorsement
                    initiative, enhanced reporting options and the choice to now avoid other players as teammates have
                    all been welcome additions to the community.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Music cues also play a big part in signaling what you’re supposed to be doing. The tense,
                    crescendoing score that accompanies the end of a match sets the scene for epic tussles. Get into
                    overtime - as the clock runs down to zero your team is making a desperate push to capture a point -
                    and the stakes are heightened once more; the music matching it step for step. The memorable refrains
                    are burned into my mind, and I often know what location I’m about to battle in next by hearing the
                    first few bars chime in before the loading screen. Each perfectly fits the setting without venturing
                    into caricature, from the weaving didgeridoos soundtracking Junkertown to the all-too-catchy beats
                    signifying that Temple of Anubis is incoming.

                    The iridescent universe that Overwatch inhabits is clear to see within seconds of booting up. Each
                    map has its own colourful twist on a real-world(ish) locale that varies from moonlit London streets
                    to a man-made colony on the moon. You must navigate the town of Eichenwalde, encompassed by the
                    littered, rusted kin of Bastion the tank strewn across the map. On Watchpoint: Gibraltar, a brief
                    sojourn upstairs in one of the spawn rooms reveals the monitor used by Winston to instigate the
                    fabled recall displayed in the opening cinematic. It’s these embellishments that set Overwatch’s map
                    pool apart from other multiplayer games. They add lashings of style while also providing informative
                    ornamentation for anyone willing to look a little closer.

                    <br>
                    Not only are they breathtaking to look at but they’re also brilliantly designed on a gameplay level.
                    All of the new additions to the pool since launch have been a roaring success: from the beautiful
                    Blizzard World that is laden with references to the studio’s other titles to the sun-drenched Oasis
                    that provides some of Overwatch’s best close-quarters firefights. The lone exception, in my
                    judgement, is the recently introduced Paris map, which has suffered from the same quarms that many
                    had with Eichenwalde in times gone by: a single choke point can be less than fun to make your way
                    through, especially when the dreaded Bunker composition is deployed, consisting of a whole team
                    taking safe-haven within Orisa’s shield and Baptiste’s Immortality Field.

                    Each location provides its own challenge and learning them intricately is mandatory for success.
                    Knowing that using Symmetra to create a teleporter across the left hand side of Volskaya Industries
                    to bypass an intimidating defensive setup can lead to an accelerated point capture. Similarly,
                    knowing where to pull off a devastating ultimate ability can turn a game in your favor in an
                    instant. Getting the high ground on point B of Hanumara’s Dojo and unleashing McCree’s High Noon has
                    won me and my team many a match.

                    It’s these moments that ultimately make Overwatch so special. The ability to work as a team to win
                    is a wholly satisfying experience, and when all the gears are in motion there’s nothing quite like
                    it. But it also offers those special moments where an individual play can win the match for your
                    team and a rush of adrenaline makes its way through your body that very few other games can
                    replicate.

                        Verdict</b>
                    <br>
                    Overwatch is a one-of-a-kind hero shooter that is far and away the best of its genre. It offers
                    variety, depth, and style that very few come close to matching. Its four-year-old foundation has
                    been lovingly crafted into the unparalleled multiplayer experience that it offers today. From its
                    now-cherished characters and expertly crafted maps to outstanding sound design and dynamic action,
                    it's a masterpiece of competitive gameplay. Most importantly of all though, it’s never stopped being
                    ridiculously fun after all these years. All of these factors combine to make Overwatch a singularly
                    special shooter, and one that I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.
